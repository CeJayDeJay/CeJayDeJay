- 👋 Hi, I’m @CeJayDeJay, Camilla Juul Dahl Jensen
- 📚 I’m a biological oceanographer educated as an ocean engineer from DTU.
- 👀 My interests are within data science and the intersection of engineering and art.
- 🌊 In my oceanographic research, I am studying functional trait distributions of zooplankton in space and time with a special focus on gelatinous plankton.
- 🔬 For this, I am working on incorporating underwater optical systems for monitoring of zooplankton using AI image recognition. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning good data management in GitHub and is exploring the usage for website creation and sharing of code. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she, her, hers
